Acetunnel is a simple http gateway tunnel which offers following:
1. Public endpoint to locally hosted servers
2. easy command line interface
3. basic logging functionality
4. basic statistics functionality


1. Tunnel:
acetunnel will be a cli tool that works in unison with its public endpoint.
it will run on localhost by calling "acetunnel [protocol] [port]", and then, the 
local client will create & assign the private endpoint a public endpoint.
All requests going to the public endpoint will then be communicated to the 
client software through an internal queuing system containing the 
request body and request id.
The client will call the local server with the request body.
after the request is complete, the client will call the request complete API,
which will get the response body,

Through internal queing in the server the request complete api will
trigger the response of the public endpoint to be sent, and it will
have the complete response object.








Functionality musts:
Server:
	1. Login Functionalities. Passwords are stored hashed
	2. Async public tunnel that puts requests on requests queue
	3. API where queued requests can be parsed by id
	4. API to store responses
	5. API to parse responses by ID (server try/fails till receiving)
	
	
Client:
	1. Login command        - acetunnel login [email] [password]
	2. Start client command - acetunnel http [port] [options] -auth? [pass]?
	3. Live server & Tunnel - acetunnel server [port] -auth? [pass]? (init live-server in pwd & tunnel)
	
	
	
HTTP Client implemented.
Site visit auth implemented.
